  about: {
    bio: "I am an AI Developer and Product Builder with a B.Tech in Computer Science and an MBA in AI & Data Science. I believe that digital interfaces are more than screens—they are spaces of human connection. I specialize in engineering systems that care about the little details: the micro-interactions that make a user smile, the quiet spaces of a layout, and the subtle nuances of an AI conversational response. By combining technical implementation with user psychology, I build products where logic meets human warmth.",
